                <u>Asia is the world's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres.</u>
                It covers 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area) and with approximately 4.3 billion people, it hosts
                60% of the world's current human population. During the 20th century Asia's population nearly quadrupled.
                <br/><br/>
                Asia is defined as comprising the eastwards four-fifths of Eurasia. It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural
                Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma-Manych Depression) and the Caspian and Black Seas.[4][5] It is
                bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean.

               In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Japan's GDP was almost as large (current exchange rate method) as that of the rest of Asia
               combined.[citation needed] In 1995, Japan's economy nearly equaled that of the USA as the largest economy in the world for a
               day, after the Japanese currency reached a record high of 79 yen/US$. Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the 1990s
               had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore located in the
               Pacific Rim, known as the Asian tigers, which have now all received developed country status, having the highest GDP per capita
               in Asia.


               It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by 2020.[36] By 2027, according to Goldman Sachs,
               China will have the largest economy in the world. Several trade blocs exist, with the most developed being the Association of
               Southeast Asian Nations.

               Asian people don’t have smaller eyes in comparison to other nationalities; they generally have the same size. They don’t see less and aren’t more sensitive to the sun.<br/><br/>
The reason why Asian people have slanted eyes is caused by the fact that they come from a place where the weather reaches the most extreme weather conditions due to the wind and cold.
The consequence of these conditions was that over time, their eyes adjusted to this. Think about a really windy day. Normally you tend to close your eyes a little bit to protect yourself from the weather.
You’d do the same to protect yourself from bright sunlight reflecting on snow. It is not only very annoying, but it’s also harmful to the eyes, and it seems that the morphology of the Asian eye helps to protect them in a very efficient way.
Ok, in Japan there are areas where the weather isn’t that extreme, but they still maintain this particular feature, though perhaps not as pronounced as other places in Asia.

                Most East Asian cuisines, with the exception of fusion and Thai, are consumed exclusively with chopsticks.
                 The more Western style cuisines favor cutlery. Some meals are more suited for the use of hands.
                 One notable trend in restaurants is the limited number of napkins provided during a meal.
                 Most mid to low-tier restaurants operate under the assumption that customers bring their own napkins or tissue packs when dining.
